## Features

This is a demonstration project of advanced WebdriverIO methods.



## Ch. 1 Utility Belt
-   Configured to run browser and see console output on a single monitor 
-   TypeScript 
-   [Expect-webdriverio](https://github.com/webdriverio/expect-webdriverio)
-   ESlint - Static code analysis tool
-   Prettier - Code formatting tool
-   Allure setup 

## Requirements
-   node >= 18 - [how to install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   yarn >= 1.22.x - [how to install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash /zsh
npm install
```

Compile TypeScript:
```bash / zsh
npm run build
```

Run e2e tests:
Run this command to test the global.log command with empty/null strings and a Promise object 
```bash / zsh
npm run wdio
```

Run this command to test the Framework DEBUG command with a longer timeout 
```bash /zsh
npm run debug
```


## Reports
### Allure
Run this command to generate the allure report in the directory `./test-report/allure-report`:
You can run this command to start a server on your machine and open the allure report on the browser:

## Prettier and Eslint
Run to format the code:
```bash / zsh
