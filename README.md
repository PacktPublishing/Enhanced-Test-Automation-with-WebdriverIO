## Note: The Chrome browser version is constantly being updated. 
If the test briefly launches a browser and fails, update "chromedriver": "^114.0.2" in package.json to the current Chrome browser version.
If the test still fails, continue to Chapter 2 regarding node-check-updates package to update all packages.
