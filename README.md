* Setting up the installation of WDIO
* Configuration of VS Code and custom settings to make life easier
* Write wrappers for Click, Select and SetValue
* Enhance data entry with self-updating data tags for date and format 
* Implement examples of class switching for self-healing objects to reduce maintenence
* Enhance reporting detail in color in the console 
* Report to Allure including screen captures
* How to skip the page object model finding objects by text alone 
* How to automate stateless end-to-end user journey where user choices change the order pages appear
